Two-Way Fibonacci Sequence in Golang

ðŸ”µ In the first sequence, the sequence prints the values â€‹â€‹already calculated on the screen,
    but if more than 40 calculations are made, the program is prone to slowdowns.

ðŸ”µ In the second sequence, not all values â€‹â€‹are printed on the screen, only the value sent
    by the user. But it is much more optimized, allowing infinite values â€‹â€‹to be entered.
